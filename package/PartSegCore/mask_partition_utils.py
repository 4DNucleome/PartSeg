"""
This module contains some not fully intuitive algorithm for splitting masked area.
They are designed for measurements, but should be also available as segmentation algorithm to
allow user to preview, for better intuition how it works and which parameters are good for their purpose.

Better option is to implement this utils as class based with base class :py:class:`AlgorithmDescribeBase`.
Then do not need to manage algorithm parameters in places where it is used.

Both class from this module are designed for spherical mask, but may be useful als for others.
