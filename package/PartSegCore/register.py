"""
This module is designed to provide more stable api for PartSeg plugins.
All operations ar class based. If, in base object, some function is @classmethod, the it can be called
without creating class instance. So also plugins need to satisfy it.

RegisterEnum: used as key in all other members. Elements are described in its docstring

base_class_dict: Dict in which information about base class for given operation is stored.
The inheritance is not checked, but api must be implemented.

register: function for registering operation in inner structures.

register_dict: holds information where register given operation type. Strongly suggest to use register function instead.
