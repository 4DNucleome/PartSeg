# Chromosome 1 territory analysis 

## Dataset 

Dataset for this tutorial can be download from [link](http://nucleus3d.cent.uw.edu.pl/PartSeg/)

This dataset contains `wpisaÄ‡` cutted nucleus with marked chromosome 1 territory.

1. Data are comes from confocal microscope. Voxel size is 77x77x210 nm   
2. Data contains four channels: 
    * channel 0  - chromosome 1 territory (without centromere). Marker do not bind uniformly to 
    chromatin so this data cannot be used to estimate chromatin density.  
    * channel 1 - chromosome 1 telomere 3'
    * channel 2 - chromosome 1 telomere 5'
    * channel 3 - chromatin density inside nucleus
3. Data are deconvoluted
